# Hand-Gensture-Controlled-Mouse-Driver
This project implements a gesture-controlled mouse driver using computer vision, where hand gestures wearing red caps act as input to control the mouse cursor. It leverages real-time camera feeds to track hand movements and map them to mouse actions such as movement, clicking, and more.
